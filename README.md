# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

In order to do this, I created a simple calendar application. It allows a user to save events for each hour of the day, by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I also used the Day.js library to work with date and time.

The app should:

<li>Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.


<li>Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.


<li>Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.


<li>Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock


<li>Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.


<li>Persist events between refreshes of a page
